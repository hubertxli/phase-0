# 1.1 Think About Time 

After reading the articles, I learned some techniques that have helped others to get into the flow. I have printed some of the tips and taped them to the wall in front of my desk. Hopefully, with some practice, I will be able to get into the zone quicker.

Time boxing is a method where you give yourself reflection time stamps. One example is the Pomodoro technique where you work for 25 minute intervals and afterwards you can assess how effectively you used your time. This strategy is something I use especially when it comes to reading textbooks. I’ll tell myself something like “let’s finish this chapter in the next 20 minutes.” Obviously, given the fact that some readings are really dense and require multiple readings to understand, I don’t always meet my self-assigned deadlines. But, I find that I will generally make good progress and the time box does give me motivation.

I plan to continue with my time box method and I will try to learn how to get into the flow faster and more often.

# 1.2 The Command Line 

A shell is a command line interface and Bash is a type of shell.
The most challenging part was navigating through folders and paths without diagrams to click on.
It took some time, but I was able to follow the instructions line by line.
I think opening a file (more) and navigating the directories (cd, ../) are the most important commands.
Pwd – prints the current directory
Ls – lists the path to the current directory

Mv – renames the first file with the second name

Cd – changes directory

../ –  moves up one directory

Touch – creates a new file

Mkdir – creates a new directory

Less – displays a file

Rmdir – removes a directory

Rm – removes a file

Help – command tells you what the argument command does
