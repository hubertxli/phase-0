Open source means anyone can use the code for free.

What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
I think open source builds a community that promotes innovation.

Assess the importance of using licenses.
Licenses allow other developers to help you.

What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
In this excercise, I practiced how to commit and push and pull repositories. I am not as nervouse about doing this anymore.
I struggled initially when the webpage repository did not have a master default branch. I think it was because I didn't give it any licence files and README files.

Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
I only used the videos and text in the modules.
